# Populated Places in North America

Build geo/topo/csv files for major Cities & Capitals in US, Canada & Mexico

## Why?

This is similar to the `us-cities` target, but:
- Uses the [Populated places](http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/mld/pop000x.html) shape file
- Contains far less points for cities/towns
- Includes places in Canada & Mexico
- Classifies 'places' based on the POPCLASS instead of simply population.
- Has a property to denote Capital cities
